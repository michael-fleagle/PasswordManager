Project: CS 112 Final Project: Password Manager

Author: Michael Fleagle
Date completed: 18-Nov-2020
Language: Python

Original Project Proposal: "I want to make a password manager that will encompass three main components: a mySQL database, 
				industry(ish) level encryption/hashing, and a simple GUI to improve user experience. The project 
				would utilize a username/password login to enable multiple users and protect each userâ€™s passwords. 
				The goal would be to create an easy to use password manager that utilizes a database and as close to industry 
				level encryption/security as possible. I would utilize the Kivy or PyQT5 library to help handle the GUI, and 
				mySQL Connector to connect to the mySQL database. More libraries may be added as needed. If I find that I have 
				more time then expected for the project, additional features may be added. 
							
Actual Project Implementation: This project creates an easy to use/simplistic password manager featuring multiple
							possible users and a basic GUI. The passwords and logins are stored in a mySQL database. 
							Unfortunately, due to time constraints and complexity no password encryption 
							was able to be implemented. 
 
							I utilize the PyQT5 library to help handle the GUI, and mySQL 
							Connector to connect to the mySQL database.
							
Project Key Aspects: GUI (using PyQt5), Database (using mySQL)

Libraries implemented: PyQt5, mysql.connector
